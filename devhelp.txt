Refer to DeprecatedRemovedStuff for stuff that's removed from actual code, but still need help with it.

To update a file's contents:

with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("naur")

"example.txt" checks if file exists, opens it, if doesn't exist makes it, "w" means write mode.

with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("new")

"a" means append, in this case, it adds a new thing to a file.

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

"r" means read, here, we are reading the file and opening it.

(import os)

os.remove("example.txt")

Here, we are removing the file.

DIFFERENT MODES:
r - Read mode
w - Write mode
a - Append mode
x - Exclusion creation mode (creates a file if doesn't exist)
r+ - Read and write mode
w+ Write and read mode
a+ Append and read mode
b - Binary mode (def wont be using this but whatever)

read_registry() - Reads the registry, and returns it.

set_registry(key: string, value: string) - Makes a new value or updates one in the registry. -- key: The name of the registry key you would like to make/update; value: The value to change the key's value to.
get_registry(key: string) - Checks if a value exists in the registry, and returns an error if doesn't. -- key: The name of the registry key you would like to check if exists.

setup.py functionality:
download(files: list, destination=None: string) - Downloads files from Github repo. -- files: A list for what files to download; destination: By default, it's to None, which means it will download to the directory the file is running in. If set to a directory, it will download to that directory.
